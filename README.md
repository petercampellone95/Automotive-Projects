## 1976 Triumph Spitfire 1500 Restoration Project
The Triumph Spitfire restoration project was an approximately 8 month long project that my father and I undertook over the winter of 2017. The goal was to restore a 1976 Triumph Spitfire 1500 that we had purchased to a fully running and driving state by replacing and/or rebuilding any components that were damaged, broken, or in a generally poor state. In general, this ended up including many different components and systems. See the Work Summary.txt file for specifics about the work that was done.
