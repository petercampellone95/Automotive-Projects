## 1976 Triumph Spitfire 1500 Restoration Project
The Triumph Spitfire restoration project was an approximately 8 month long project that my father and I undertook over the winter of 2016. The goal was to restore a 1976 Triumph Spitfire 1500 that we had purchased to a fully running and driving state by replacing and/or rebuilding any components that were damaged, broken, or in a generally poor state. In general, this ended up including many different components and systems. See the Work Summary.txt file for specifics about the work that was done.

## 1993 Mazda Miata Project
The Mazda Miata project was done with a fellow engineering student and old friend from Wentworth Institute of Technology. The project started with an empty Mazda Miata shell and the goal was to effectively put the entire car back together. Luckily, we had the vast majority of the required parts on hand from the previous owner so all we needed was a comprehensive manual and some tools. Over several very late nights during the summer of 2016 the car was slowly put back together and eventually completed in September of 2016.

### Mazda Miata Active Wing Project
 Sometime after the Mazda Miata was rebuilt and back on the road we came up with the idea to design an active aerodynamics system akin to something you would see on a high-end sports car or exotic. Specificially, our idea was to build a system that would raise or lower a rear wing based on speed in order to increase downforce at higher speeds for better cornering. Given my experience and knowledge of electrical engineering I was focused on designing the circuitry and eventually the PCB that would be at the center of the entire system while my colleague would focus on the software that would control the operation of the wing. In the project's current state the schematics for the electronics are 90% completed pending some verification and review. Currently though, the project is put on hold as other modifications to the Mazda Miata are being performed. Take a look at the schematics and other files to get an idea of our initial design philosophy and direction.
